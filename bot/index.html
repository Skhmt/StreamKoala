<p>
  This is a simple page for my bot... for now.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://skhmt.github.io/bot/dist/bot%200.4-bin.7z">0.4</a> (<a href="http://skhmt.github.io/bot/dist/bot%200.4-src.7z">source</a>)
</p>
<p>
  This bot was made in javascript, html, css, and node-webkit (node.js). I used libraries from <a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc">node-irc</a>, <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js</a>, and <a href="https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/">clipboard.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Instructions: download, run the .exe, go to the "Settings" tab, click "Get token", sign in to Twitch, copy the token to include "oauth:", close the pop-up window, paste it into the field next to "Access Token: " and hit "Save token".
</p>
<p>
  If you're using your bot with a Twitch user other than your primary account, make sure the bot is both a mod and editor in your channel. Go to your Twitch Dashboard to set your bot's account as an editor.
