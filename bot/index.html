  This is a simple page for my bot... for now.
</p>
<p><b>
  Latest version: <a href="dist/bot0.4b.zip">0.4b</a> (15 Dec 2015)
</b></p>
<p>
  This bot was made in javascript, html, css, and node-webkit (node.js). I used libraries from <a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc">node-irc</a>, <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js</a>, and <a href="https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/">clipboard.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Instructions:</b> download, run the .exe, go to the "Settings" tab, click "Get token", sign in to Twitch, copy the token to include "oauth:", close the pop-up window, paste it into the field next to "Access Token: " and hit "Save token".
</p>
<p>
  <b>Change log:</b><br>
  0.4b: added generic BTTV emotes, made the font a little smaller, added !bottime, !streamtime, !laptime, and the ability to choose which time !uptime uses. Added laptime so you can save, for example, the start of a 24 hr stream that !uptime will count from even if your computer crashes. Minor UI changes all around.
  <br>
  0.4a: fixed a bug with !quote that could randomly play a quote even if it was deleted. Also made emoticons a tiny bit smaller to fix the problem with the auto-scroll not working.

  If you're using your bot with a Twitch user other than your primary account, make sure the bot is both a mod and editor in your channel. Go to your Twitch Dashboard to set your bot's account as an editor.
